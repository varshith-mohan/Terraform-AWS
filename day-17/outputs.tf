    Blue-Green Deployment Demo Instructions
    ========================================
    
    1. VERIFY BLUE ENVIRONMENT (Production - v1.0):
       Visit: ${aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment.blue.cname}
       Expected: "Welcome to Version 1.0 - Blue Environment"
    
    2. VERIFY GREEN ENVIRONMENT (Staging - v2.0):
       Visit: ${aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment.green.cname}
       Expected: "Welcome to Version 2.0 - Green Environment"
    
    3. PERFORM THE SWAP:
       Run this AWS CLI command to swap the CNAMEs:
       
       aws elasticbeanstalk swap-environment-cnames \
         --source-environment-name ${aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment.blue.name} \
         --destination-environment-name ${aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment.green.name} \
         --region ${var.aws_region}
    
    4. VERIFY THE SWAP:
       After the swap completes (takes ~1-2 minutes):
       
       Blue URL now shows v2.0:
       Visit: ${aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment.blue.cname}
       Expected: "Welcome to Version 2.0 - Green Environment"
       
       Green URL now shows v1.0:
       Visit: ${aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment.green.cname}
       Expected: "Welcome to Version 1.0 - Blue Environment"
    
    5. ROLLBACK (if needed):
       Simply swap again using the same command to revert!
